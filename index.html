                    First and foremost, this is my submission for AME 111, as shown by the tab title.
                    I'm a computer science major and haven't really went in depth into web dev, but I 
                    completely custom made this website to try it out so please disregard the wacky url, 
                    I'm on a student budget. Sike the hosting service I normally use is being sued >:( 
                    . Yikes so the site should be custom but being hosted on my github. 
                    This is going to be temporary, I'll need the url again within the month.
                    I work pretty exclusively
                    on projects that are non-visual so I did my best to make the site reactive for different
                    monitor resolutions and scales, but just don't push it too hard please.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of the actual blog, I'm one of those nutcases that really enjoys programming,
                    not just for school. Now don't get me wrong, I won't say the idea of the paycheck isn't
                    a supporting factor. I find that I spend most of my free time working on projects for 
                    my personal use. I'll start on a project, and then start another to help with the first,
                    and then its been 3 months and its finally done. So this is a dump of dev thoughts and what's
                    going on. :D
                    <br><br>
                    In the posts section, you can find some posts about what I've recently or currently am 
                    working on.
                    <br><br>
                    And in the *Algorithm of the Month* (oooh, ahhhh, fancy ikr) section you can expect to find some obscure algorithm
                    that I wish was feasable to implement in my projects.
