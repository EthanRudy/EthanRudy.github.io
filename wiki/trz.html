                        Yes a game! As the player progresses through the levels, starting from one NAND gate, you design & build a turing complete computer,

                    <h1>CPU Structure</h1>
                    <h2>Program Memory & Counter</h2>
                    <p>
                        Program Memory is, for lack of a better word, array of bytes, 256 to be exact. As you can see, there is one input (blue) on the left, 
                        and 4 outputs to the right (green). Each instruction is 32 bits. For clarity's sake 32 bits == 4 bytes == 2 words == 1 DWORD.
                        <br><br>
                        When executing an instruction the CPU reads 4 bytes at a time (the 4 highlighted numbers). The first byte is the opcode, the 
                        2nd byte is Argument 1, the 3rd is  Argument 2, making the 4th and final byte the Destination. 
                        <br><br>
                        I'll be referencing these bytes using: opcode, arg1, arg2, & dest. 
                        <br><br>
                        When moving to the next instruction, we have to move 4 bytes, since that is the span of ALL instructions. You can learn more about
                        my endeavors wiring some variable length instructions in the "Mistakes" section below.

                    <h2>Opcode Decoder</h2>
                    <h3>
                        In this section we will be focusing on the opcode decoder!
                    </h3>
                    <img src="/media/projects/trz/opcode.png">
                    <p>
                        The game is nice enough to provide me with the ability to label wires! I have labeled <i>most</i> of the super duper important ones.
                        The first byte of every instruction is the opcode, meaning Operation Code. Operations include general arithmetic, stack functions, RAM
                        accessing, jumps, function calling. It defines what the CPU will do with the following 3 bytes. 
                        <br><br>
                        My CPU has 25 opcodes! To differentiate
                        25 unique values, I need to decode 5 bits. Yes we have some excess but theres always room to improve.
                        <br><br>
                        I might have lied about the 5 bits, I actual use 7 bits. The first 5 bits denote the operation, the 6th denotes if our operation is jump
                        , and the 7th denotes if it's an immediate instruction. Fear not, I have an explanation!
                        <br><br>
                        From the first 5 bits, I use 17 unique combinations.
                        <br>
                        From the 6th bit, I read if it's a jump because our counter our program relies on will have to overriden, the COND component will have
                        to be enabled, and our opcodes overlap! Check the OPCODE section for an explanation of that last part
                        <br>
                        From the 7th bit, I read if the instruction has an immediate value. An immediate value is a value directly passed by the programmer. 
                        Any other values must be read from a register or game components. Just like the 6th bit, the 7th bit is what I call a modifier. 
                        <br><br>
                        For example:
                        <br>
                        If I want to add a register and immediate value, I would use the opcode for add (00000000), and toggle the immediate bit (7th), making
                        (0100000). This in turn provides functionality for ALL instructions to have an immediate counterpart. I'm not saying that its a good choice,
                        but arg2 could be an immediate if the programmer so chose.
                        <br><br>
                        24 of the opcodes, the 25th is special!
                    </p>
                    <img src="/media/projects/trz/opcode_tower.png">
                    <p>
                        Instructions on the right of the pipe "|", need the condition bit (6th) to be toggled on to function.
                        <br><br>
                        Below is a full opcode decoder, It could be minimized but I like seeing the wires activate as I debug.

                    <h2>Argument Decoders</h2>
                    <h3>3 Arguments, 3 Decoders</h3>
                    <img src="/media/projects/trz/argument_decoders.png">
                    <p>
                        As you can see above, we have a decoder for each of the remaining 3 arguments, as well as a switch on the 2nd argument. This switch
                        is directly connected to the immediate bit and the ALU, bypassing the registers entirely, proving our immediate functionality.
                        <br><br>
                        You also may notice, we only use 4 bits of our 8. This is because I have only 11 registers, and didn't need to use the whole byte.
                        For Register info, see the following section.
                        <br><br>
                        All 11 of the colorful wires link to a different register. Argument 1 & 2 link to the registers' load pin, meaning it will read data,
                        and Destination links to the registers' save pin, meaning it will store data.
                        <br><br>
                        If you havent figured out by now, most opcodes perform an action using arg1 & arg2 and stores it at dest.
                        <br><br>
                        The white wires link to some game components. It is still a game so sometimes you have to send or receive some value from the backend.
                        Arg1 & 2 link to input, Dest links to output. 
                        <br><br>
                        For example, if I wanted to double the input and send the result to the output immediately,
                        i could say 'add, in, int, out'. The Argument decoders would unlock the input, send the data to the ALU to their respective lines, 
                        the ALU performs the addition and sends it to the, dest line and the dest decoder unlocks the output. You can learn more about
                        the "lines" in the "Registers" section.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Registers</h2>
                    <h3>Wiring Hell</h3>
                    <img src="/media/projects/trz/all_registers.png">
                    <h3>
                        All 11 registers (gray wire labels)
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Before we get to far, I need to address the usage of the word "line." See all of those switches on the right? Those are linked to Arg1 & Arg2.
                        Arg1 reads to the purple line, and Arg2 reads to the dark blue line. They go all over the place, but lets focus on just the ALU & COND.
                        <br><br>
                        The registers aren't too crazy but the final note I have is only Reg1-8 are for "general use."
                        <br>
                        That top register is the ZERO register, and it holds a constant value of 0, and can never be written to, only read from. Denoted 
                        by "RO", read only. 
                        <br>
                        The same applies for the lowest 2, lo and hi. These are used to store the upper and lower bits of multiplication (8bit * 8bit == 16bit) and 
                        the (quotient, remainder) pair of the divide/modulus operation. They are only written to when the ALU needs them, but can be read at any time.
