                <h1 class="post_title">C++ BigInteger</h1>
                <p class="post_text">
                    I have spend an embarrassing amount of time on this <a href="https://github.com/EthanRudy/BigInt">project</a> over the last year.
                    At this point I'm currently working on the 5th version lol.<br><br>
                    The point of a library like BigInt is store store and manipulate arbitrary sized
                    integers. I originally started working on this when working on, guess what, another project. yay!
                    That other project, I can't share publicly but I'm working on something cool to show this off.
                    The reason this exists is as follows, the language I use most often C++, is limited by it's
                    number storage. Integers aka whole numbers are commonly stored in 
                    <a href="https://medium.com/@luischaparroc/integer-numbers-storage-in-computer-memory-47af4b59009">this fashion</a>
                    And because of this "hard" limit, you can only go so big. In my case, its about 19 digits or something.
                    For one of my problems I had to add a couple hundred, 50 digit numbers, so thats where this all started.
                    This library allows for an "infinitely" large number, you just need to have enough storage in memory.
                    <br><br>
                    Other languages have this functionality built in. Python is a good example, you can go as big as your
                    computer will let you, straight out of the box. Other languages, like Java, you just have to import
                    their package in your code. Its like getting a book from a library. Once you have the book, you have
                    the knowledge inside. Java's BigInteger library is open and readable by the public, and version 3 was
                    based off of it, but its way advanced for me to understand. Some true magic going on over there.

                    <br><br>
                    All prior 4 versions where based around structures that hold a list/array/string of digits. If you had
                    the number 10, it would be represented as { 0, 1 }, it's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">backward</a>"
                    for some simplicity reasons so I don't get even balder. I then program each operation. This includes
                    arithmetic (+, -, *, / %), boolean (<, >, ==, !=), and some other quality of life ones.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    This 5th version, and I feel stupid for not thinking of it sooner, is chunk based. Similarly as to how
                    Minecraft loads its world in 16 x 16 chunks, I store my numbers in 9 digit chunks. (9 digits for the same balding reason)
                    
                    This is great for this reason. Lets say you don't use chunks and add 12 and 13. You have to add the 2 and 3, then the 1's.
                    Which is ok, except when your computer is calculating the factorial of 1 million (which the new version 
                    can do with ease. slay) This number has around 5.5 million digits. Multiplication as you learned in 
                    like 2nd grade, is just some additions shifts for place. This method's operation count is ~n^2, n being the
                    length of the number. Meaning on the last calculation alone, with this digit by digit, no chunk method, the
                    computer would have to do 30,250,000,000,000 operations (30 trillion ish). Obv this isn't fast. But if
                    we represent our number as chunks, we get to do 1/9 the operations when adding, and even less when muliplying.

                    <br><br>
                    Better yet, since we use chunks, if both numbers are less than 9 digits, we can add them normally, so we have
                    good performance with small numbers too.

                    <br><br>
                    I profusely apoligize for this, that was a lot and I applaud you for reading all the way here. I really
                    like stuff like this so I could go on and on.

                <p class="post_text">
                    <a href="https://github.com/EthanRudy/OSHA-Sort">OSHA Sort</a> is a complete joke. I was bored one day this summer.
                    It's a simple, well known sorting algorithm, but with a twist. It's "labor law" compliant because I want to be on the
                    robots good side when they take over lol. For every index that they program sorts, it gets to take a breather in terms
                    of a one second break. Additionally, theres a small chance that it clocks out for its lunch break, and takes a chill pill
                    for 30 whole minutes. It took like 20 minutes to make but I thinks its pretty funny.

                <p class="post_text">
                    This was my full obsession 2nd semester of last year. I wanted to learn some graphics libraries for C++ and landed on one
                    called SFML. And that allowed me to create visuals for my programs, instead of the black and white, text only console I 
                    normally work with.
                    <br><br>
                    It turned out alright, theres some things I want to improve on if I ever get around to rewriting it, specifically a really
                    cool optimization.
                    <br><br>
                    The code itself is found <a href="https://github.com/EthanRudy/PhysEngine">here</a> if you want to decipher my code. It's
                    currently held together with masking tape. In terms of what it does, it just simulates water particles in real time. Not too good though.
                    The first try is found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxioJbSxQ2U">here</a>. They were way too bouncy, the time scale was
                    super off, over all not too convincing. The second version, demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2eG8HxBvr0">here</a> had
                    some really beneficial optimizations, as well as being more lightweight on the memory. It could handle about 1000 objects in real time,
                    about 10 times more than the prior, and could hit around 5000 objects and remain stable without becoming a microsoft powerpoint
                    everytime it had to do math. I'm pretty proud of it, an explanation is found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFGE34j8KTo">here</a>
